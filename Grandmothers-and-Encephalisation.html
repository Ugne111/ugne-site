        An essay written during my time in Cambridge evaluating the evidence for the role of grandmothers in the evolution of encephalized hominins. At the time, exploring this particular topic piqued my interest in the evolution of our species. I found it very interesting to think about how something quite unremarkable, such as the existence of grandmothers, had a profound impact that typically you would not consider. The exploration of this topic also contributed to the budding frustration with male-centric narratives in almost every corner of every niche I find myself in. The very popular idea that contemporary cognition was contingent on hunter fathers provisioning for their families was challenged by the work of Kristen Hawkes. It makes me wonder how many other well established theories exist that completely overlook the contribution of women.

        The evolution of encephalized hominins, characterised by an increase in brain size relative to body size, stands as one of the pivotal stages in the evolution of modern humans. Grandmothers have been theorised to play a significant role in enabling the evolution of encephalization and it has been argued that without their contributions an increase in brain size may have not occurred. An increase in brain size incurs several implications, the costs of which grandmothering may have aided in countering. The grandmother hypothesis posits that the extended post-reproductive life of human females has been selected for due to the inclusive benefits acquired by aiding direct descendants. In this essay, I will start with the suggestion that a secondary altriciality is required in order to give birth to infants with large brains, which would in turn increase the length of juvenile dependency. To mitigate this, alloparental care would have been required. I then discuss an argument against the role of grandmothers in providing care. This argument is that according to Hamilton’s rule, fathers should play a more significant role since they are more closely related to the offspring. Finally, I outline how grandmothering could have contributed to the evolution of encephalized hominins. 

Ecological conditions faced by the first encephalized hominins would have favoured the benefits conferred by grandmothering. This is to offset the costs incurred by the evolution of larger brains relative to body size. During the initial appearance of Homo erectus, around 1.8 million years ago, the climatic conditions in which the species inhabited would have experienced increased aridity due to the global climatic trend at the time towards cooler, drier and more seasonal conditions. As a consequence, the hominins at this period were facing new selection pressures in order to acclimate to the novel food and their distributions. This drove the hominins into different niches, the robust hominins invested in large mastication muscles and large teeth to be able to ingest tough food. On the other hand, early Homo species were experiencing an increase in brain size. For instance, Homo habilis is considered the first encephalized hominin observed in the fossil record. The extent of their encephalization is not extreme, however, the pattern continues in later hominins and Homo erectus had a cranial capacity intermediate between australopithecines and modern humans, ranging between 800-1100 cc (O’Connel, 1999). This evolutionary trajectory results in modern humans having a brain six times larger than predicted by their body size (Martin, 1981). Due to the physical constraints of the mother's pelvis, the size of the brain achieved at birth is only 30% of the adult size and the rate of postnatal brain growth remains high during the first 1.5 years (Cofran et al., 2015). This is termed secondary altriciality and has several social implications, such as an extended juvenile dependency relative to other primates. A study by Cofran and colleagues supports the notion of secondary altriciality in Homo erectus based on the skull of a Mojokerto child. They suggest the likely lower range of estimated brain growth would be intermediate between apes and humans, depending on the analytical approaches used to estimate the age of the Mojokerto skull (Cofran et al., 2015). This would imply that Homo erectus infants would have been nursed until at least the first year of life, placing a great emphasis on motherly provisioning. To mitigate this energetic burden on females it has been hypothesised that alloparental care could have been implemented. 


Kin selection theory suggests this care would have been provided by grandmothers and that they played a significant role in the evolution of encephalized hominins as a result. The concept underlying kin selection is that the genes of a given individual can be transmitted by means other than personal reproduction. This type of natural selection favours the reproductive success of close relatives since it provides inclusive fitness benefits to the individual, in this case, the grandmother. This would imply that during the time of encephalization, when extended care became required for the survival of infants, there was a selection pressure for help by grandmothers. Hamilton's rule, which suggests parameters that must be met in order for the prosocial behaviour to be selected, has been involved in many models of alloparenting. The equation is rb>c, where r is the genetic relatedness between the alloparent and the offspring, b is the total fitness benefit to the offspring, and c is the fitness cost to the alloparent (Cofran et al.,2015). This equation would suggest that the father’s involvement would be under a much larger selection pressure since their degree of relatedness to the offspring is larger than the grandmother's. This is one objection to the role of grandmothers in provisioning offspring, that fathers would undermine care offered by grandmothers, especially since they are more closely related to the offspring. 

Conventional theory regarding the costs incurred by encephalization emphasises the role of hunter-fathers in supporting their families. Faunal assemblages associated with early Pleistocene archaeological sites include remains of larger animals, some with bones damaged by stone tools, supporting the notion of males hunting big game. Furthermore, there are also indications that meat was transported from kill sites, presumably to be provisioned to dependent mates and offspring by males (Isaac, 1978). Kristen Hawkes (2017) and colleagues argue that the grandmother hypothesis offers an alternative scenario to the commonly attributed involvement of big game hunting and family provisioning by men in the evolution of Homo erectus. Hawke argues that the evidence advocating for hunting fathers provisioning their kin is weak, and therefore could not afford the increased energetic costs due to an extended period of juvenile dependence. For instance, she suggests analyses of some of the damage patterns on bones do not indicate any hominin involvement, and if they do, it is no more than ‘passive’ hominin activity, implying any edible tissue gained from scavenging would have been not enough and too irregular to sustain a family (O’Connell, 1999). 

Moreover, when considering the energy spent on childrearing by either mothers or fathers, paternity uncertainty must be taken into account as this would influence parental involvement. Trivers (1972) proposes that it is easier to assign biological mothers to their children than biological fathers and that this uncertainty reduces a father’s willingness to invest in their presumed offspring. On the other hand, maternal grandmothers are unique alloparents in that they have certainty in their relatedness to their grandchildren and, therefore, would be more willing to offer care than fathers (Watkins, 2021). In general, evidence suggesting that a hunter-father would not supply sufficient food to meet nutritional demands, alongside an unwillingness to support their offspring due to uncertainty of paternity, indicate that fathers would not have been suitable for providing the care necessary for offsetting the costs of extended offspring helplessness. Since maternal grandmothers are guaranteed that their care would benefit the welfare of their direct descendants, hence increasing their inclusive fitness, and are unable to reproduce themselves, they are the most likely candidate for the alloparent that would aid the mother in raising offspring.


Grandmothers played a crucial role in the evolution of encephalized hominins as without alloparental care, maintaining population stability would not be possible. Supervision of offspring and performing tasks, such as food collection, reduces the energetic burden on mothers, thereby decreasing the interbirth interval between grandchildren as well as increasing their chances of survival (Watkins, 2021). Furthermore, the first two years of life have been suggested to be especially important for establishing the cognitive potential of the brain. This is because the brain during this period does not grow uniformly, but rather has a high rate of proliferation of white matter i.e., myelinated axons. These are responsible for forming connections between different brain regions (Cofran et al., 2015). Grandmothers, therefore, would be crucial during this period of high plasticity in children and may have served as repositories of valuable knowledge and cultural practices. In this way, knowledge transfer could occur, which is particularly valuable with the increasing social complexity accompanied with encephalization. It is clear why post-reproductive females who contribute to the survival of their grandchildren have been argued to increase the overall reproductive success of their genetic lineage. 

However, the premise of the grandmother hypothesis does not rely solely on these benefits to argue that grandmothers were valuable for the evolution of encephalized hominins. Instead, the hypothesis rejects the notion of meat being the primary source of nutrition since there is supposedly little indication of meat consumption by hominins (Hawke,1999). Hawke claims that a reduction in available resources easily consumed by children (e.g. fruit) prompted the exploitation of tubers instead as they are readily available during dry seasons. This enabled grandmothers to significantly contribute to the nutrition of offspring enough to facilitate grandmothering as an adaptation. However, I do not believe tubers, which are difficult to process and most likely mechanically and chemically guarded, are sufficient in maintaining the metabolic demands a larger brain requires. Furthermore, the concept underlying the expensive tissue hypothesis posits that to increase the size of our brains relative to our bodies we have reduced other ‘expensive’ tissues to maintain an achievable metabolic rate. In 1995, Aiello and Wheeler provided evidence for a strong negative correlation between gut size and brain size in primates. A decrease in gut size would necessitate a shift to a higher-quality diet that has a smaller surface area to aid digestion. This presents an opportunity for carnivory for early Homos, through scavenging carcasses left by carnivores in the savannah. Despite the notion that Homo erectus most plausibly shifted to carnivory rather than relying solely on tubers for nutrition, I do not believe this undermines the role that grandmothers played in the evolution of encephalized hominins. Due to the costs incurred by an increase in brain size relative to body size, several mechanisms had to be implemented to counter this. One of these mechanisms could have been the evolutionary trade-off between gut size and brain size, thus necessitating a shift in diet where meat is the primary source of nutrition. However, due to heterochronic changes in brain growth leading to a secondary altriciality in Homo infants, grandmothering would have been crucial in aiding mothers with the extended period of juvenile helplessness. The role of grandmothers was possibly vital in the persistence of the Homo genus as they lowered interbirth intervals enabling the maintenance of population stability and increasing the chance of survival for offspring. 

To conclude, climactic-driven adjustments in niche exploitation led early Homo species to develop larger brains relative to their body size. As a result of physical constraints, due to the mother’s pelvis, most growth of the brain occurs postnatally. This secondary altriciality incurs more energetic demands on mothers which requires the aid of an alloparent. This alloparent is arguably a maternal grandmother as suggested by the theory of kin selection. Since paternal uncertainty is negatively correlated with a father’s willingness to aid offspring, the father is unreliable with regard to providing parental care. Furthermore, the arguments against the theory of big game hunting suggest fathers would not provide sufficient food to meet the nutritional demands of the mother and kin. On the other hand, to be able to sustain the metabolic costs of a large brain, a switch to carnivory is required. This does not, however, undermine the role of grandmothers in the evolution of encephalized hominins. Grandmothering reduces the interbirth intervals, necessary for a stable population, and in general, increases the reproductive success of the genetic lineage.
